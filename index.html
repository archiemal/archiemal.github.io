            <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Archie. Welcome to my website!</p>
        <p>This is a portfolio demonstrating my work, particularly my computer science development work that I have completed in university.</p>
        <p>I have had a long-time passion for the subject; in particular, I have a passion for programming and problem-solving. The satisfaction I receive from crafting an elegant solution for a problematic piece of code, or working out the perfect algorithm for the task I am trying to achieve, is second to none.</p>
        <p>I am hugely enthusiastic about learning; be that developing new skills, or refining my current ones. In the context of computer science, this comes in the form of learning new languages and experimenting with new technologies. An example of this is DungeonGame on my GitHub page, which was a project I started to get to grips with C#. More on this can be seen on the 'Projects' page.</p>
        <p>I also have a strong passion for nature; I greatly enjoy going on long walks, on my own, or with loved ones. For me, maintaining a balance between technology and nature in my life is greatly important, so naturally a great passion for technology would also go hand-in-hand with a great passion for nature. These indulgences in nature can also be a great source of inspiration to me - taking a step away from the computer and letting my mind breathe has helped me overcome many programming challenges.</p>
        <p>I'll occasionally take pictures when I'm out on walks, which are included on this website. They are intended to be a preservation of a sight I have found particularly appealing in nature, and a momento I can show friends and family.</p>
        <p>My greatest passion outside of computer science is music; I play guitar and bass, and occasionally work on digital music production. I believe there is a link between programming and music, as you learn there is a defined set of logic and rules to structure and develop the project, and make the final result satisfactory. Listening to music while programming is also great for helping me concentrate, and helps drive me forward.</p>
