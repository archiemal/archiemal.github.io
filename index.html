            <h3>CYOScript</h3>
            <p>CYOScript (Choose-Your-Own Script) was my final major project for university, and the largest, most complete piece of individual work I have done to date. This is a scripting language for creating narrative, text-based choose-your-own adventure games. The complex language back-end code is encapsulated in a library behind a facade pattern, which makes it easy to integrate into other projects.</p>
            <p>The project includes the language back-end and a simple GUI, as well as a set of unit tests to prove the program works. I intend to make updates for this project after I graduate, adding some extra features in my free time.</p>
            <p>I cannot make the source code for this program public yet as it is still being assessed. As soon as I can, though, the code will be hosted on GitHub and linked here.</p>
